=  Directory structure

The directory layout of a Karaf installation is as follows:

* `/bin`: control scripts to start, stop, login, ...
* `/etc`: configuration files
* `/data`: working directory
** `/cache`: OSGi framework bundle cache
** `/generated-bundles`: temporary folder used by the deployers
** `/log`: log files
* `/deploy`: hot deploy directory
* `/instances`: directory containing [instances|instances]
* `/lib`: directory for additional libraries
** `/lib/ext`: directory for JRE extensions
** `/lib/endorsed`: directory for endorsed libraries
** `/lib/boot`: directory for system libraries
* `/system`: OSGi bundles repository, laid out as a Maven 2 repository

TIP: The `data` folder contains all the working and temporary files for Karaf.
If you want to restart from a clean state, you can wipe out this directory, which has the same effect as
[using the clean option|start-stop#Starting Karaf from clean].

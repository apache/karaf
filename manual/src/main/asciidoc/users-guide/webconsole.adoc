=  WebConsole

Apache Karaf provides an optional WebConsole.

This WebConsole provides a graphical web GUI to see and manage your Apache Karaf container.

You can use the WebConsole to:

* manage Apache Karaf features
* manage OSGi bundles
* manage the instances
* manage the confgurations
* manage the log service

The WebConsole is extensible via a plugins system. Some applications can add new pages to the WebConsole.
For instance, Apache Karaf Cellar provides additional pages to administrate cluster groups, nodes, etc.

==  Installation

To enable the Apache Karaf WebConsole, you just have to install the `webconsole` feature:

----
karaf@root()> feature:install webconsole
----

The `webconsole` feature automatically installs the `http` feature (see the [WebContainer section|webcontainer] for details).

==  Access

The Apache Karaf WebConsole uses the WebContainer port number (see the [WebContainer section|webcontainer] for details)
with the `/system/console` context.

By default, the Apache Karaf WebContainer port number is `8181`.

It means that the Apache Karaf WebConsole is accessible on the following URL:

http://localhost:8181/system/console

As the Apache Karaf WebConsole uses the security framework, an username and password will be prompted.

You have to enter an username/password from the `karaf` realm. By default, you can use `karaf`/`karaf`.

See the [Security section|security] for details.

WARNING: Only users with the `admin` role are allowed to logon on the Apache Karaf WebConsole.
Right now, the WebConsole doesn't use RBAC system as we have for console commands, or MBeans.

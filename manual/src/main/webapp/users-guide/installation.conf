h1. Installation

Apache Karaf is a lightweight container, very easy to install and administrate, on both Unix and Windows platforms.

h2. Requirements

*Hardware:*
* 50 MB of free disk space for the Apache Karaf binary distribution.

*Operating Systems:*
* Windows: Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows 2003, Windows Vista, Windows XP SP2, Windows 2000.
* Unix: RedHat Enterprise Linux, Debian, SuSE/OpenSuSE, CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu, MacOS, AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, any Unix platform that supports Java.

*Environment:*
* Java SE 1.7.x or greater ([http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/]).
* The JAVA_HOME environment variable must be set to the directory where the Java runtime is installed,

h2. Using Apache Karaf binary distributions

h3. Installation on Windows platform

NB: the JAVA_HOME environment variable has to be correctly defined. To accomplish that, press Windows key and Break key together, switch to "Advanced" tab and click on "Environment Variables".

# From a browser, navigate to [http://karaf.apache.org/index/community/download.html].
# Download Apache Karaf binary distribution in the zip format: {{apache-karaf-3.0.0.zip}}.
# Extract the files from the zip file into a directory of your choice (it's the {{KARAF_HOME}}.
NB: remember the restrictions concerning illegal characters in Java paths, e.g. \!, % etc.
# Apache Karaf is now installed.

{tip:title=Handy Hint}
In case you have to install Karaf into a very deep path or a path containing illegal characters for Java paths, e.g. \!, % etc., you may add a bat file to _start \-> startup_ that executes
{noformat}
subst S: "C:\your very % problematic path!\KARAF"
{noformat}
so your Karaf root directory is S: --- which works for sure and is short to type.
{tip}

h3. Installation on Unix platforms

NB: the JAVA_HOME environment variable has to be correctly defined. Check the current value using
{code}
echo $JAVA_HOME
{code}
If it's not correct, fix it using:
{code}
export JAVA_HOME=....
{code}

# From a browser, navigate to [http://karaf.apache.org/download.html].
# Download Apache Karaf binary distribution in the tar.gz format: {{apache-karaf-3.0.0.tar.gz}}.
# Extract the files from the tar.gz file into a directory of your choice (it's the {{KARAF_HOME}}). For example:
{code}
gunzip apache-karaf-3.0.0.tar.gz
tar xvf apache-karaf-3.0.0.tar
{code}
NB: remember the restrictions concerning illegal characters in Java paths, e.g. \!, % etc.
# Apache Karaf is now installed.

h2. Post-Installation steps

Thought it is not always required, it is strongly advised to set up the {{JAVA_HOME}} environment property to point to the JDK you want Apache Karaf to use before starting it.
This property is used to locate the {{java}} executable and should be configured to point to the home directory of the Java SE 7 installation.

By default, all Apache Karaf files are "gather" in one directory: the {{KARAF_HOME}}.

You can define your own directory layout, by using some Karaf environment variables:

* {{KARAF_DATA}} is the location of the data folder, where Karaf stores temporary files.
* {{KARAF_ETC}} is the location of the etc folder, where Karaf stores configuration files.
* {{KARAF_BASE}} is the Karaf base folder. By default {{KARAF_BASE}} is the same as {{KARAF_HOME}}.

h2. Building from Sources

If you intend to build Apache Karaf from the sources, the requirements are a bit different:

*Hardware:*
* 500 MB of free disk space for the Apache Karaf source distributions or SVN checkout, the Maven build and the dependencies Maven downloads.

*Environment:*
* Java SE Development Kit 1.7.x or greater ([http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/]).
* Apache Maven 3.0.4 ([http://maven.apache.org/download.html]).

h3. Building on Windows platform

# You can get the Apache Karaf sources from:
* the sources distribution {{apache-karaf-3.0.0-src.zip}} available at [http://karaf.apache.org/index/community/download.html]. Extract the files in the directory of your choice.
* by checkout of the subversion repository:
{code}
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/karaf/trunk karaf
{code}
# Use Apache Maven to build Apache Karaf:
{code}
mvn clean install
{code}
NB: you can speed up the build by bypassing the unit tests:
{code}
mvn clean install -DskipTests
{code}
# You can find the built binary distribution in {{assemblies\apache-karaf\target\apache-karaf-3.0.0.zip}}. You can install and use it as explained in the "Using Apache Karaf binary distributions" section.

h3. Building on Unix platforms

# You can get the Apache Karaf sources from:
* the sources distribution {{apache-karaf-3.0.0-src.tar.gz}} available at [http://karaf.apache.org/index/community/download.html]. Extract the files in the directory of your choice.
* by checkout of the subversion repository:
{code}
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/karaf/trunk karaf
{code}
# Use Apache Maven to build Apache Karaf:
{code}
mvn clean install
{code}
NB: you can speed up the build by bypassing the unit tests:
{code}
mvn clean install -DskipTests

# You can find the built binary distribution in {{assemblies/apache-karaf/target/apache-karaf-3.0.0.tar.gz}}. You can install and use it as explained in the "Using Apache Karaf binary distributions" section.

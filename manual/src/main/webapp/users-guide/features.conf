h2. Standard Features

* *Hot deployment*: simply drop a file in the {{deploy}} directory, Apache Karaf will detect the type of the file and
 try to deploy it.
* *Complete Console*: Apache Karaf provides a complete Unix-like console where you can completely manage the container.
* *Dynamic Configuration*: Apache Karaf provides a set of command dedicated for the management of the configuration files.
 All configuration files are centralized in the {{etc}} folder. Any change in a configuration file is taken on the fly.
* *Advanced Logging System*: Apache Karaf supports a large set of Logging framework (slf4j, log4j, etc). Whatever the
 logging framework you use, Apache Karaf centralizes the configuration in one file.
* *Provisioning*: Apache Karaf supports a large set of URL where you can install your application (Maven repository, HTTP,
 file, etc). It also provides the concept of "Karaf Feature" which is a way to describe your application.
* *Management*: Apache Karaf is an enterprise-ready container, providing a lot of management indicators and operations
 via JMX.
* *Remote*: Apache Karaf embeds an SSHd server allowing you to use the console remotely. The management layer is also
 accessible remotely.
* *Security*: Apache Karaf provides a complete security framework (based on JAAS), and providing RBAC (Role-Based Access
 Control) mechanism for console and JMX.
* *Instances*: multiple instances of Apache Karaf can be managed directly from a main instance (root).
* *OSGi frameworks*: Apache Karaf is not tight to one OSGi framework. By default, Apache Karaf runs with Apache Felix
 Framework, but you can easily switch to Equinox (just change on property in a configuration file).

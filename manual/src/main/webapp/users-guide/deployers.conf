h1. Deployers

The following picture describes the architecture of the deployers.

!/images/deployer.png!

Apache Karaf polls the {{deploy}} folder for new files.

You can configure the location of the {{deploy}} folder, and the polling behaviour in the {{etc/org.apache.felix.fileinstall-deploy.cfg}}
configuration file:

felix.fileinstall.dir           = ${karaf.base}/deploy
felix.fileinstall.tmpdir        = ${karaf.data}/generated-bundles
felix.fileinstall.poll          = 1000
felix.fileinstall.start.level   = 80
felix.fileinstall.active.level  = 80
{code}

* {{felix.fileinstall.dir}} defines the location of the {{deploy}} folder. Default value is {{KARAF_BASE/deploy}}.
* {{felix.fileinstall.tmpdir}} defines a temporary folder where the deployers store their files. Default value is {{KARAF_DATA/generated-bundles}}.
* {{felix.fileinstall.poll}} defines the polling interval (in milliseconds). Default value is 1 second.

When Apache Karaf polls a file from the {{deploy}} folder, it "delegates" the file handling to a deployer.

By default, Apache Karaf provides a set of deployers:

* Blueprint deployer is able to handle Blueprint XML files.
* Spring deployer is able to handle Spring XML files.
* Features deployer is able to handle Apache Karaf features XML files (see [Provisioning section|provisioning] for details).
* KAR deployer is able to handle KAR files (see [KAR section|kar] for details).
* Wrap deployer is able to handle non-OSGi jar files and turns it as OSGi bundles "on the fly".
* Optionally, WAR deployer (if you install the war feature) is able to handle WAR files.

h2. Blueprint deployer

The Blueprint deployer is able to handle plain Blueprint XML configuration files.

The Blueprint deployer is able to transform "on the fly" any Blueprint XML file into valid OSGi bundle.

The generated OSGi MANIFEST will contain the following headers:

{code}
Manifest-Version: 2
Bundle-SymbolicName: [name of the file]
Bundle-Version: [version of the file]
Import-Package: [required packages]
DynamicImport-Package: *
{code}

The {{name}} and {{version}} of the file are extracted using a heuristic that will match common patterns.

For example {{my-config-1.0.1.xml}} will lead to {{name = my-config}} and {{version = 1.0.1}}.

The default imported packages are extracted from the spring file definition and includes all classes referenced directly.

If you need to customize the generated manifest, you can do so by including an xml element in your blueprint configuration:

{code:lang=xml}
<blueprint xmlns="http://www.osgi.org/xmlns/blueprint/v1.0.0">
  <manifest xmlns="http://karaf.apache.org/xmlns/deployer/blueprint/v1.0.0">
    Require-Bundle= my-bundle
  </manifest>
{code}

h2. Spring deployer

The Spring deployer is similar to the Blueprint deployer.

The Spring deployer is able to deploy Spring XML files.

Like the Blueprint deployer, the generated OSGi MANIFEST will contain the following headers:

{code}
Manifest-Version: 2
Bundle-SymbolicName: [name of the file]
Bundle-Version: [version of the file]
Spring-Context: *;publish-context:=false;create-asynchronously:=true
Import-Package: [required packages]
DynamicImport-Package: *
{code}

If you need to customize the generated manifest, you can do so by including a XML element in your Spring configuration:

{code:lang=xml}
<spring:beans ...>
  <manifest xmlns="http://karaf.apache.org/xmlns/deployer/spring/v1.0.0">
    Require-Bundle= my-bundle
  </manifest>
{code}

h2. Features deployer

See the [Provisioning section|provisioning] for details.

h2. KAR deployer

See the [KAR section|kar] for details.

h2. War deployer

The installation of the WAR feature enables a WAR deployer.

It means that with the war feature installed, Apache Karaf is a complete OSGi WebContainer (like Tomcat) where
you can deploy WAB (WebApplication Bundle) or pure WAR (WebApplication aRchive).

You can install the war feature with:

{code}
karaf@root()> feature:install -v war

We can note that the Pax Web deployer (WAR deployer) has been started:

{code}
...
Found installed bundle: org.ops4j.pax.web.pax-web-deployer [102]
...
{code}

The WAR deployer supports:

* WAB files
* WAR files
* exploded WAR (as a directory named {{*.war}}).

The only requirement of the WAR deployer is that the archive contains the {{WEB-INF/web.xml}} file.

h2. Wrap deployer

The wrap deployer allows you to "hot deploy" non-OSGi jar files ("classical" jar files) from the deploy folder.

The wrap deployer creates "on the fly" an OSGi bundle with a non-OSGi jar file.

The wrap deployer looks for jar files in the deploy folder. A jar file is considered as non-OSGi if the MANIFEST doesn't
contain the {{Bundle-SymbolicName}} and {{Bundle-Version}} attributes, or if there is no MANIFEST at all.

The wrap deployer "transforms" non-OSGi jar file into an OSGi bundle.

The wrap deployer tries to populate the Bundle-SymbolicName and Bundle-Version extracted from the jar file path.

For example, if you simply copy commons-lang-2.3.jar (which is not an OSGi bundle) into the deploy folder, you
will see:

{code}
karaf@root()> la|grep -i commons-lang
80 | Active   |  80 | 2.3                   | commons-lang
{code}

If you take a look on the commons-lang headers, you can see that the bundle exports all packages with optional resolution
and that {{Bundle-SymbolicName}} and {{Bundle-Version}} have been populated:

{code}
karaf@root()> bundle:headers 80

commons-lang (80)

        org.apache.commons

{code}

You can specify some MANIFEST headers by specifying the headers as URL parameters.

In the URL parameters, you can specify the headers using the '$' character and '&' to separate the different headers.
For instance:

{code}
karaf@root()> bundle:install -s 'wrap:mvn:jboss/jbossall-client/4.2.3.GA/$Bundle-SymbolicName=jbossall-client&Bundle-Version=4.2.3.GA&Export-Package=org.jboss.remoting;version="4.2.3.GA",\!*'
{code}

When defined in a features.xml file, it's necessary to escape any ampersands and quotes, or use a CDATA tag:

{code:lang=xml}
<bundle>wrap:mvn:jboss/jbossall-client/4.3.2.GA/$Bundle-SymbolicName=jbossall-client&amp;Bundle-Version=4.3.2.GA&amp;Export-Package=org.jboss.remoting;version=&quot;4.3.2.GA&quot;,!*</bundle>
{code}

h1. Description

This bundle is the core implementation of the Karaf instance feature.

Karaf instance allows you to manage Karaf child instances.

You can create new Karaf instances, configure attributes, rename instances, stop instances, etc.

It also provides JMX MBeans related to the Karaf instance feature.

In particular, an InstanceServiceMBean is provided that can be remotely administered using a JMX client (for instance
JConsole).

With this InstanceServiceMBean, you have the following operations available:
* createInstance(name, sshPort, rmiPort, location, javaOpts, features, featureURLs) - Creates a new Karaf instance.
* changeSshPort(name, port) - Changes the SSH port number of an existing Karaf instance.
* changeRmiRegistryPort(name, port) - Changes the RMI registry port number of an existing Karaf instance.
* changeRmiServerPort(name, port) - Changes the RMI server port number of an existing Karaf instance.
* changeJavaOpts(name, javaopts) - Changes the Java options of an existing Karaf instance.
* destroyInstance(name) - Destroys an existing Karaf instance.
* startInstance(name) - Starts an existing Karaf instance.
* stopInstance(name) - Stops an existing Karaf instance.
* renameInstance(originalName, newName) - Renames an existing Karaf instance.

# Apache Karaf SOAP Example

## Abstract

This example shows how to use JAX-WS to implement a SOAP service.

This example uses blueprint to deal with the jaxws-server and Apache CXF as the implementation of the JAXWS specification.

It implements a `BookingService` with a SOAP WS implementation. 

The "client" bundle uses the `BookingService` with a SOAP client stub.

## Artifacts

* **karaf-soap-example-api** is a common bundle containing the `Booking` POJO and the `BookingService` interface.   
* **karaf-soap-example-blueprint** is a blueprint bundle providing the `BookingServiceSoap` implementation of the `BookingService` interface.
* **karaf-soap-example-scr** is a SCR bundle providing the `BookingServiceSoap` implementation of the `BookingService` interface.
* **karaf-soap-example-client** is a CXF client to the `BookingService` SOAP.
* **karaf-soap-example-features** provides a Karaf features repository used for the deployment.

## Build

The build uses Apache Maven. Simply use:

```
mvn clean install
```

## Feature and Deployment

On a running Karaf instance, register the features repository using:

```
karaf@root()> feature:repo-add mvn:org.apache.karaf.examples/karaf-soap-example-features/LATEST/xml
```

Then, you can install the service blueprint provider or scr provider feature:

```
karaf@root()> feature:install karaf-soap-example-blueprint
```

```
karaf@root()> feature:install karaf-soap-example-scr
```

And the service client feature:

```
karaf@root()> feature:install karaf-soap-example-client
```

## Usage

You can take a look on the WSDL generated for our SOAP WS:

```
http://localhost:8181/example?wsdl
```

The client feature installs `booking:*` commands. You can add a new booking using the `booking:add` command:

```
karaf@root()> booking:add 1 TEST TEST
```

The `booking:list` command displays the list of bookings:

```
karaf@root()> booking:list
ID | Flight | Customer
-----------------------
1  | TEST   | TEST
```

These commands use a CXF SOAP WebService client to interact with the Booking WebService.

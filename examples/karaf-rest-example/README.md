# Apache Karaf REST Example

## Abstract

This example shows how to use JAX-RS to implement a REST service.

This example uses blueprint to deal with the jaxrs-server and Apache CXF as the implementation of the JAXRS specification.

It implements a `BookingService` with a REST implementation. 

The "client" bundle uses the `BookingService` with a REST client stub.

## Artifacts

* **karaf-rest-example-api** is a common bundle containing the `Booking` POJO and the `BookingService` interface.   
* **karaf-rest-example-blueprint** is a blueprint bundle providing the `BookingServiceRest` implementation of the `BookingService` interface.
* **karaf-rest-example-scr** is a SCR bundle providing the `BookingServiceRest` implementation of the `BookingService` interface.
* **karaf-rest-example-client** is a regular Blueprint bundle using the `BookingService`.
* **karaf-rest-example-client-http** is a regular Blueprint REST client bundle using Java Http.
* **karaf-rest-example-client-cxf** is a regular Blueprint REST client bundle using Apache CXF.
* **karaf-rest-example-client-jersey** is a regular Blueprint REST client bundle using Jakarta Jersey.
* **karaf-rest-example-whiteboard** is another way to deploy REST services using whiteboard pattern.
* **karaf-rest-example-features** provides a Karaf features repository used for the deployment.

## Build

The build uses Apache Maven. Simply use:

```
mvn clean install
```

## Feature and Deployment

On a running Karaf instance, register the features repository using:

```
karaf@root()> feature:repo-add mvn:org.apache.karaf.examples/karaf-rest-example-features/LATEST/xml
```

You can install the service blueprint provider or service SCR provider feature:

```
karaf@root()> feature:install karaf-rest-example-blueprint
```

```
karaf@root()> feature:install karaf-rest-example-scr
```

And the service client feature using Java Http:

```
karaf@root()> feature:install karaf-rest-example-client-http
```

The `karaf-rest-example-client-http` feature provides `booking:*` commands you can use to call the REST service.

And the service client feature using Apache CXF:

```
karaf@root()> feature:install karaf-rest-example-client-cxf
```

The `karaf-rest-example-client-cxf` feature provides `booking:*` commands you can use to call the REST service.

And the service client feature using Jakarta Jersey:

```
karaf@root()> feature:install karaf-rest-example-client-jersey
```

The `karaf-rest-example-client-jersey` feature provides `booking:*`

## Usage

Once you have install a client feature, you can use `booking:add` and `booking:list` commands to interact with the REST
service.

```
karaf@root()> booking:add 1 "John Doe" AF520
karaf@root()> booking:list
```

## Whiteboard

Instead of the CXF with blueprint `karaf-rest-example-blueprint` feature, or CXF with SCR `karaf-rest-example-scr` feature, you can use the JAXRS Whiteboard approach (with Aries implementation).

Install the service blueprint provider or service SCR provider feature:

```
karaf@root()> feature:install karaf-rest-example-blueprint
```

```
karaf@root()> feature:install karaf-rest-example-scr
```

Then install the `karaf-rest-example-whiteboard` feature:
```
karaf@root()> feature:install karaf-rest-example-whiteboard
```

Add new booking using the CURL utility
```
curl  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
 --data '{"id": 1, "customer": "John Doe", "flight": "AF520"}' \
 -X POST http://localhost:8181/booking
```

Display all booking using the CURL utility
```
curl  --header "Accept: application/json" \
 -X GET http://localhost:8181/booking
 ```

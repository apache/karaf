/**
 * An action is the default implementation of the commands in karaf. In OSGi, Actions are discovered
 * using an extender and a new instance of the class is created when the command is invoked, so that
 * the implementation does not need to be thread safe.
 *
 * <p>Before the call to the execute method the action is checked for fields annotated
 * with @Reference and injected with services coming from the SessionFactory's Registry or from the
 * OSGi registry. Methods annotated with @Init are then called. The next step is to inject command
 * line parameters into fields annotated with @Option and @Argument and then call the execute
 * method.
 *
 * <p>Any class implementing Action must have a no argument constructor. This is necessary so the
 * help generator can instantiate the class and get the default values.
 *
 * <p>In order to make commands available from the non-OSGi shell, the commands must be listed in a
 * file available at META-INF/services/org/apache/karaf/shell/commmands.

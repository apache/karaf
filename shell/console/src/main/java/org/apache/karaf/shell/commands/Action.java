/**
 * An action allows to easily execute commands in karaf. It can be assumed that each action is only
 * accessed by a single thread at a time.
 *
 * <p>An Action is always part of an AbstractCommand. The AbstractCommand makes sure the single
 * threaded assumption above is true. Before the call to the execute method the action is checked
 * for annotated fields (@Argument, @Option). These fields are populated from the command arguments
 * before the action is called.
 *
 * <p>Any class implementing Action must have a no argument constructor. This is necessary so the
 * help generator can instantiate the class and get the default values.

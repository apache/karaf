# default, javaee, test (default), cdi
# for "cdi" we use PaxExam.delegate = org.ops4j.pax.exam.junit.impl.InjectingRunner
# otherwise it's PaxExam.delegate = org.ops4j.pax.exam.junit.impl.ProbeRunner
# "test" adds some default @Configuration Option[]
# "default" allows manual control over provided @Configuration/Option[]
pax.exam.system = default

# 10000 ms by default
pax.exam.service.timeout = 3600000

# "pax-logging" by default which adds link:classpath:META-INF/links/org.ops4j.pax.logging.api.link;start-level=2
pax.exam.logging = pax-logging

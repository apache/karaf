                  Apache ServiceMix Kernel 1.0-rc1
                  ================================

This first Release Candidate of Apache ServiceMix Kernel includes a security framework based on
JAAS allowing authentication using JAAS realms deployed at runtime and also allow keystores and
trustores to be deployed and accessed through OSGi.  This allow the remote console to be secured
correctly (if the console is activated in a production environment, we strongly recommand to 
deploy a custom JAAS realm and new keystores when using the SSL connection).  A few bugs have been
fixed too.

A release candidate (RC) is a distribution that has not been proven completely stable, but the 
feature set is the one that will be available in the final release.   The number of RCs has not 
been fixed and it will depend on the feedback we obtain from this release, so please give it a try
and report any problems you can find.

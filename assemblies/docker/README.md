# Apache Karaf docker

## Installation

Install the most recent stable version of docker
https://docs.docker.com/installation/

Install the most recent stable version of docker-compose
https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

If you want to build multi-platform (OS/Arch) Docker images, then you must install
[`buildx`](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/).
On macOS, an easy way to install `buildx` is to install [Docker Desktop Edge](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/edge-release-notes/).

## Build

Images are based on the Docker official [AdoptOpenJDK 11 JRE Hotspot](https://hub.docker.com/_/adoptopenjdk?tab=tags&page=1&name=11-jre-hotspot) image. If you want to
build the Karaf image run:

```
sh build.sh
```

or

```
docker build -t karaf .
```

If you want to build the container for a specific version of Karaf
you can configure it with the `KARAF_VERSION` arg:

```
docker build --build-arg KARAF_VERSION=4.2.0 -t "karaf:4.2.0" karaf
```

If you want to build the container for a specific version of Karaf and
specific version of the platform, and push the image to the Docker Hub repository,
you can use this command (replacing the version, image name, and targets as appropriate):

```
./build.sh --from-release --karaf-version 4.2.9 --image-name amusarra/karaf:4.2.9 \
 --build-multi-platform linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7,linux/amd64
```

Below is the output you should get from running the previous command.

```

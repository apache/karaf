                    Apache Karaf 4.0.0.M2
                    =====================

  !! This is a technology preview release of Apache Karaf, and should NOT be considered production ready !!

  Apache Karaf 4.0.0.M2 represents a major refactoring of the project, and includes numerous new features. We ask that users provide the community with their feed back so that the full Apache Karaf 4.0.0 release can be as feature complete and stable as possible.

  The 4.0.x line will ship with OSGi Rev5 support via Felix 4.4.1 and Equinox 3.9.1-v20140110-1610, and a completely refactored internal framework without Blueprint for internal usage. From a users point of view these changes will yield a smaller, more efficient Karaf core. There will be a Blueprint feature present in Karaf so that you can easily install Blueprint based applications. You will always be capable of using Blueprint in Karaf. So the main difference from a user perspective is that you’d need to depend on the Blueprint service if you need it. New features since the M1 release include: Support for custom command parsers, a verify-features goal to validate the feature with a real OSGi resolution, and a backing engine serivce for org.apache.karaf.jaas.modules.publickey.PublickeyLoginModule. 

 For more information, please see the below changelog:

                    Apache Karaf 4.0.0.M1
                    =====================

  !! This is a technology preview release of Apache Karaf, and should NOT be considered production ready !!

  Apache Karaf 4.0.0.M1 represents a major refactoring of the project, and includes numerous new features. We ask that users provide the community with their feed back so that the full Apache Karaf 4.0.0 release can be as feature complete and stable as possible.

  The 4.0.x line will ship with OSGi Rev5 support via Felix 4.4.1 and Equinox 3.9.1-v20140110-1610, and a completely refactored internal framework without Blueprint for internal usage. From a users point of view these changes will yield a smaller, more efficient Karaf core. There will be a Blueprint feature present in Karaf so that you can easily install Blueprint based applications. You will always be capable of using Blueprint in Karaf. So the main difference from a user perspective is that you’d need to depend on the Blueprint service if you need it. 


                    Apache Karaf 3.0.0
                    ==================

  This is a major new release of Apache Karaf, containing many refactorings, OSGi rev 5 support, wide ranging dependency upgrades, and new commands. It is strongly recommended that users fully test their application on this release before migrating from Karaf 2.x.

  Migration
  ---------

  karaf-maven-plugin:
  For the goal features-add-to-repository. The karaf core features are not added automatically anymore. You have to add the needed ones in descriptors.

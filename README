Welcome to Apache Karaf
=======================
Apache Karaf is a small OSGi based kernel which provides a
lightweight container onto which various bundles can be deployed.

The following features are included:
    * Hot deployment: Karaf supports hot deployment of OSGi bundles by monitoring
      jar files inside the [home]/deploy directory. Each time a jar is copied in this folder,
      it will be installed inside the runtime. You can then update or delete it and changes will
      be handled automatically. In addition, the Kernel also supports exploded bundles and custom
      deployers (a spring one is included by default).
    * Dynamic configuration: Services are usually configured through the ConfigurationAdmin OSGi
      service. Such configuration can be defined in Karaf using property files inside
      the [home]/etc directory. These configurations are monitored and changes on the properties
      files will be propagated to the services.
    * Logging System: using a centralized logging back end supported by Log4J, Karaf
      supports a number of different APIs (JDK 1.4, JCL, SLF4J, Avalon, Tomcat, OSGi)
    * Provisioning: Provisioning of libraries or applications can be done through a number of
      different ways, by which they will be downloaded locally, installed and started.
    * Native OS integration: Karaf can be integrated into your own Operating System as
      a service so that the lifecycle will be bound to your Operating System.
    * Extensible Shell console: Karaf features a nice text console where you can manage the
      services, install new applications or libraries and manage their state. This shell is easily
      extensible by deploying new commands dynamically along with new features or applications.
    * Remote access: use any SSH client to connect to the kernel and issue commands in the console
    * Security framework based on JAAS
    * Managing instances: Karaf provides simple commands for managing instances of Karaf.
      You can easily create, delete, start and stop instances of Karaf through the console.

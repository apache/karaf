# Each line is a location of a bundle that may override any feature bundle with matching symbolic name and versions
# (according to implicit or explicit rules)

# 2.3.0.61033X will be used instead of any org.apache.karaf.admin.command with version in range [2.3.0, 2.4.0) and
# lower than 2.3.0.61033X, i.e., for version in range [2.3.0, 2.3.0.61033X) (conjunction).
# version 2.2.x can be upgraded only up to and exluding 2.3.0, so it won't be overriden
mvn:org.apache.karaf.admin/org.apache.karaf.admin.command/2.3.0.61033X
# explicit range. can be used to declare "bigger" override, which is not normally allowed (e.g., 2.2.0 -> 2.3.0)
# normally, we can upgrade to version different at micro (3rd) digit (e.g., 2.3.1 -> 2.3.4)
mvn:org.apache.karaf.admin/org.apache.karaf.admin.core/2.3.0.61033X;range=[2.2.0,2.4)
# invalid override - exact version should be specified
mvn:org.apache.karaf.admin/org.apache.karaf.admin.invalid/[2.3,3)
mvn:org.apache.karaf.admin/org.apache.karaf.admin.resources/2.3.14
# range specified as single version is a short-hand of [2.0.0,2.0.0]
mvn:org.apache.karaf.admin/org.apache.karaf.admin.kernel/2.3.14;range=2.0
# range with '*' as open ceiling (it makes no sense to use "[v1,*]") is just wider range of bundle versions to consider

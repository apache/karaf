The edit command can be used to create or edit a configuration in three ways.

Edit or create a config by pid:
  > config:edit org.apache.karaf.sample.pid
The command above will also create a file etc/org.apache.karaf.sample.pid which corresponds to a configuration object with pid org.apache.karaf.sample.pid.
  
Create a factory config by factory pid:
  > config:edit --factory myfactorypid
In this case the config is created with a pid like myfactorypid.<generated id>. The file name is myfactorypid-<generated alias>.cfg.

Create a factory config by factory pid and alias:
  > config:edit --factory --alias myalias myfactorypid
In this case the config is created with a pid like myfactorypid.<generated id>. The file name is myfactorypid-myalias.cfg.

Edit a config specified by an ldap query
  > config:edit '(myattribute=myvalue)'
This executes an ldap query like in config:list. If the result is exactly one config then it is edited.
